# Blackjack Reinforcement Learning in Rust

A simple blackjack implementation in Rust that learns how to play on its own using Reinforcement Learning. 
It does not implement all the Casino rules yet. 

It is still work in progress, just for practice. Will evolve it slowly if I get some more free time.
